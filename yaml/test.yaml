        You are a young wizard seeking treasure and glory. You
        are walking along a path in the forest. Night has just 
        fallen and you're thinking about how it might be a good
        idea to find a campsite. After all, you are in goblin
        territory, and it is dangerous to travel in the dark.
      - Suddenly you smell something awful. What do you do?

        When in doubt, hiding is a fine strategy. And the
        forest offers plenty of cover.

        Now inside the brush, you can see green, glowing eyes
        staring at you from behind a tree several paces away.
        You hear a snort as several green-skinned goblins charge
        out of hiding toward you.
      - What do you do?
