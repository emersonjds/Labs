Directives

ddo = directive definition object
ddo.restrict = can use like atribute in a determineted div or like a html tag

When use directive on html the name of directive uses trace do declare
for example myPanel in js archive, on html we use my-panel, it's convention to angular community

All directives can have only one isolated scope, very similar to the controller $ scope
but this scope does not influence the external context in which this directive is called

So that there is communication when the directive is called in the middle of
the html and it is possible to pass which data will be treated
within the directive with the @ character, if the attribute
name is the same as declared within the directive scope,
just use the @ that the directive understands the association that is made with the declared tag

example
<my-panel title="title"></my-panel>

On directive title is called with title: @ because the property is equal

NG-TRANSCLUDE

Whenever there are child elements in a directive it is necessary 
to use the angular ng-transclude, so the directive can render the child elements within it, 
and in the markup it is necessary to use ng-transclude for that code snippet to render
